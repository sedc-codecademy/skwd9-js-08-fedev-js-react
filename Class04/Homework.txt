Homework requirements: 

1. From swapi api, which we used on the previous class fetch the "people" (as same as we did in class).
And print the names in the UI.

2.Next to the names that are previously printed, add a toggle button that will have the value "show/hide" details
(the value is changed based if we showed something or if we hide something). 

3.When clicking the button with value "show" on the right side or on the bottom (your choice) we show a div or 
table (your choice as well :D ) with the details of the character. As you can guess now when we showed details for 
that person/character that button will have the value of "hide". While this "transition" is happening, we must alert
the user if we are loading for the details of that character or the details are loaded. (This means when we click
on show details first we will alert the user "Loading Deatails" and once the details are showed or displayed we 
will notify the user that deatails are beign loaded as "Details Loaded").

BONUS:
1. Make pagination for the people (this means we will have additional next and previous button), and when
there will be no more people to display we should hide the Next or Previous button. For example if there are 
only 10 pages, and we are currently on the 10th page, the Next button should be hidden or at least disabled. 
Same rule for previous. Also print somewhere or atleast log on which page are we at now, and on which page we were before.
2. Change the color of the font or the background of the character which details are displayed.
